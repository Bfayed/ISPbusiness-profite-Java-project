I was hired by a fictional internet provider to compute yearly profits. Customers pay
fixed monthly fees. The ISP makes a profit when customers do not use all the bandwidth
they are allowed. Such users are called “Casual’ users. The region to which the provider
supplies internet is in the form of an n x m grid. The ISP can provide internet to each cell in
the grid if desired.
